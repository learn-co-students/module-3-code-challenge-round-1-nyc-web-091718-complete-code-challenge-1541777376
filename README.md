# JavaScript Code Challenge

## Objectives

- DOM Manipulation
- Events and Event Handlers
- Callbacks
- Fetching from APIs

## Instructions

Today we're building RandoPic, an app for viewing a random picture. There is a backend API that we have provided. You will be building out the frontend for this app.

A RandoPic user will be able to do the following things:

- As a user, when the page loads I will see an image, any comments that image has, and the number of likes that image has.

- As a user, I can click to like an image, which will increase the number of likes that image has by one.

- As a user I can fill out an input fields and submit the form to add a comment to an image. I should see my new comment below any previous comments.

- As a user, when I refresh the page, any comments or likes I have added should be persisted to the backend API and I should see my changes on the page.

## Deliverables and How to Approach

For this challenge it is important to work iteratively, one feature at a time, before moving on to the next. You should **prioritize making code that works over attempting all of the deliverables.** It is better to have a handfull of fully working features than 10 things that were attempted but do not work.

We have provided what we believe to be a good breakdown of how to approach the this problem:

## Step 1 - Get the Image Data  ###############DONEDONEDONE

When the page loads you will need to make a request to the API to get the data about your picture. The API follows RESTful conventions.

#### API Docs

#### Endpoint to show an individual Image

Visit 'https://randopic.herokuapp.com/'. The application will assign you your very own `image_id`.  **THIS IS YOUR ASSIGNED IMAGE. This prevents your classmates from editing your images and vice versa**.

**Before you start anything else, locate the variable `imageId` in the `src/index.js`. Replace the value of the variable with your image id, and use it as the `/:id` parameter in your initial GET request.** This will be the image you'll be working with for this code challenge.

```js
GET 'https://randopic.herokuapp.com/images/:id'
```

```json
Example Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "url": "http://blog.flatironschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/072716-js-saved-web-4-352x200.jpg",
  "name": "The Internet!",
  "like_count": 0,
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": 5941,
      "content": "first comment!",
      "image_id": 1158,
      "created_at": "2018-10-18T17:06:14.859Z",
      "updated_at": "2018-10-18T17:06:14.859Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the data from the API response to append the information to the DOM. You will need to add:

- the image url  DONE
- the image name DONE
- the number of likes DONE
- any comments in an unordered list DONE

Your HTML might look something like this (obviously you'd need to replace `ðŸ¤”` with the actual data):

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row" id="image_content">
    <div class="card col-md-4"></div>
    <div id="image_card" class="card col-md-4">
      <img src="ðŸ¤”" id="image" data-id="ðŸ¤”"/>
      <h4 id="name">ðŸ¤”</h4>
      <span>Likes:
        <span id="likes">ðŸ¤”</span>
      </span>
      <button id="like_button">Like</button>
      <form id="comment_form">
        <input id="comment_input" type="text" name="comment" placeholder="Add Comment"/>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
      </form>
      <ul id="comments">
        <li>ðŸ¤”</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="card col-md-4"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

(If you cannot get your fetch request to work correctly you can always use the example response above to append content to the DOM and work with for the subsequent steps)

## Step 2 - Like Feature (Frontend) DONE

The next feature to approach is the functionality to add likes to a picture. First get this working in the browser only without worrying about persistence. DONE

Clicking the 'Like' button should increase the number of likes by one. DONE

A user can like the same picture multiple times. DONE

---

## Step 3 - Like Feature (Backend) DONE

This app will use what is called _optimistic rendering_. This means the DOM will be updated before the changes are added to the database. When a user clicks the 'Like' button we will immediately update the DOM. Next your job is to make a POST request to persist the new Like in the backend database.

#### API Docs

#### Endpoint to create a Like

In the request's body key, set `image_id` to your assigned `id`. This will tell your new like which image it belongs to (remember database associations?ðŸ˜±).

```js
POST 'https://randopic.herokuapp.com/likes'

Required keys in the body of the request:
{
  image_id: <insert image id here>
}

Required Headers
{
  'Accept': 'application/json',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

```json
Example Response:
{
    "id": 112,
    "image_id": 8,
    "created_at": "2017-11-17T13:52:22.167Z",
    "updated_at": "2017-11-17T13:52:22.167Z"
}
```

Since we are using optimistic rendering, you shouldn't have to do anything with the response.

To test your code you should be able to refresh the page and see the number of likes be the increased number.

---

## Step 4 - Comment Feature (Frontend) DONE

The next feature to approach is the functionality to add comments to a picture. First get this working in the browser only without worrying about persistence.

DONE Filling out the input and clicking 'Submit' should append your new comment as an `<li>` to the comments unordered list element.

 DONE You should also clear out the comment input, so it's an empty field for the next comment to be added. DONE

## Step 5 - Comment Feature (Backend) DONE

As before, after optimistically rendering a comment we need to persist the comment to the database.

#### API Docs

#### Endpoint to create a Comment

Similarly to before, this POST request's body should include the your assigned `imageId`. Remember associations? A `comment` `belongs_to` an `image`, so we need to send the `image_id` that the comment should be associated with:

```js
POST 'https://randopic.herokuapp.com/comments'

Required keys in the body of the request:
{
  image_id: <insert image id here>,
  content: <insert comment content here>
}

Required Headers
{
  'Accept': 'application/json',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```


```json
Example Response (created comment):
{
  "id": 5,
  "content": "nice",
  "image_id": 1,
  "created_at": "2018-10-18T19:10:40.369Z",
  "updated_at": "2018-10-18T19:10:40.369Z"
}
```

Since we are using optimistic rendering, you shouldn't have to do anything with the response.

To test your code you should be able to refresh the page and see any comments you added.

## BONUS - NOT REQUIRED

## Step 6 - Delete a comment feature

This feature is not required and you should only attempt if you have time.

When you display new comments add a button next to each comment to delete that comment.

Clicking the button should delete the comment from the DOM as well as deleting it from the database.

Take the same iterative approach as before.

#### API Docs

#### Endpoint to delete a Comment

```
DELETE 'https://randopic.herokuapp.com/comments/:comment_id'

Example Response:
{
  message: 'Comment Successfully Destroyed'
}
```

_(Hint: To get the comment's id you may have to think about changing the way you handle the response received from creating a comment)_
